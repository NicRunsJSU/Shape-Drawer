# Shape-Drawer
An assignment for my technical writing class at Jacksonville State University. October 2018
## What Does it Do?
This program randomly generates 30 random shapes(squares, circles, and triangles) and stores them in ArrayList<Shapes>. It then draws each object on a Jframe and tags each shap with it's area. 
## Getting Started
These instructions will allow you to download the program and get it up and running on your machine. After that, you will be able to test and edit the code to fit your needs. 
## Prerequisites 
For this program to work, you must select the right form of [JAVA SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for your operating system. 
## Installing 
1. Download the program to the location that you wish for the it to reside. 
2. Test whether the program works.
   * Click on the project folder.
   * Go into the dist folder.
   * Run the Lab_5D.jar and a frame should open with 30 random shapes (either squares, circles, or triangles) with their volumes tagged to them.
